# 5-Agent Taskmaster Implementation Summary

## What I've Created

### 1. **Comprehensive Task Structure** (`/workspace/tasks/expansion/AGENT_TASKMASTER_TASKS.md`)
- **91 total tasks** organized hierarchically
- **2,576 total hours** of work (12 weeks × 5 agents × 40 hours)
- Each task has:
  - Unique ID (e.g., AGENT1-201)
  - Clear description and deliverables
  - Time estimates
  - Priority levels
  - Tags for filtering
  - Dependencies where needed

### 2. **Task Breakdown by Agent**

#### Agent 1: Data Pipeline (17 tasks, 480 hours)
- Foundation setup (Kafka, schema design)
- Reddit integration with WSB features
- Multi-platform social media ingestion
- Data quality and optimization
- Monitoring dashboard

#### Agent 2: Mobile App (20 tasks, 480 hours)  
- React Native setup
- Dashboard with visualizations
- Stock details and search
- Alert system UI
- Gamification features
- Offline mode
- App store preparation

#### Agent 3: ML Models (15 tasks, 480 hours)
- Infrastructure setup
- FinBERT fine-tuning
- WSB language model
- Advanced prediction models
- Bot detection
- Model serving API
- Continuous learning pipeline

#### Agent 4: Backend API (18 tasks, 480 hours)
- API architecture
- Authentication system
- Core sentiment endpoints
- Alert engine
- Screening engine
- WebSocket support
- Performance optimization

#### Agent 5: Web Frontend (17 tasks, 480 hours)
- Next.js setup
- Dashboard components
- D3.js visualizations
- Stock screener UI
- Real-time updates
- Mobile responsiveness

### 3. **Integration Checkpoints**
- **SYNC-001**: Week 2 - API contracts defined
- **SYNC-002**: Week 6 - Services connected
- **SYNC-003**: Week 9 - Full system test
- **SYNC-004**: Week 12 - Launch preparation

### 4. **How to Use These Tasks**

#### For Manual Entry:
1. Copy commands from the task file
2. Run them in your terminal
3. Tasks will be created with proper hierarchy

#### For Bulk Loading:
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x /workspace/tasks/expansion/load_all_tasks.sh

# Run it (when taskmaster is available)
./workspace/tasks/expansion/load_all_tasks.sh
```

#### For Cursor Agents:
Give each agent their section of tasks:
- "Agent 1: Use tasks AGENT1-000 through AGENT1-500"
- "Agent 2: Use tasks AGENT2-000 through AGENT2-700"
- etc.

### 5. **Task Management Commands**

```bash
# View all tasks for an agent
python -m taskmaster.cli get_tasks --tags agent1

# Update task progress
python -m taskmaster.cli update_task AGENT1-201 --status in_progress

# View critical path
python -m taskmaster.cli get_tasks --priority critical

# Check sync points
python -m taskmaster.cli get_tasks --tags sync

# Generate Gantt chart
python -m taskmaster.cli export_timeline RETAIL-EPIC --format gantt
```

### 6. **Success Tracking**

The tasks include specific metrics to track:
- **Week 2**: API contracts, mock data, basic UI
- **Week 6**: 1M posts/day, 70% ML accuracy
- **Week 12**: 10M posts/day, 85% accuracy, store ready

### 7. **Risk Management**

High-risk tasks are identified:
- Twitter API rate limits (AGENT1-301)
- Push notification approvals (AGENT2-401)
- WSB model quality (AGENT3-201)
- Alert engine complexity (AGENT4-400)
- D3.js performance (AGENT5-300)

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Clear Ownership**: Each agent knows exactly what to build
2. **Parallel Development**: Minimal dependencies between agents
3. **Progress Tracking**: Easy to see who's ahead/behind
4. **Flexible Execution**: Can adjust priorities as needed
5. **Complete Coverage**: Every feature has a task

## Next Steps

1. **Launch Agents**: Give each agent their task list
2. **Set Up Tracking**: Use taskmaster to monitor progress
3. **Daily Updates**: Each agent updates their main task
4. **Weekly Reviews**: Check metrics and adjust

This task structure enables true parallel development with clear accountability and measurable progress toward your MVP launch!
