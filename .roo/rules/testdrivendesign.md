Test-Driven Design Rule
Whenever you request a new feature, change, or refactor:
1. Plan:
- I will outline a clear, step-by-step plan for the feature or change, including the intended behavior and edge cases.
Write Tests:
 - Before implementing any code, I will write tests that define the expected behavior, covering both typical and edge cases.
 - These tests will be as specific as possible, and will fail initially (red state).
Implement:
- I will implement the feature or change, writing only the code necessary to make the tests pass (green state).
Test, Debug, Re-Test:
 - I will run the tests, debug any failures, and re-run until all tests pass and the implementation meets the requirements.
- Only after all tests pass and the code is clean will I consider the task complete.
